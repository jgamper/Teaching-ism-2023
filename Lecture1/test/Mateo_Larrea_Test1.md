1. What does cold start problem mean in Machine Learning in practice? How does it examplify in book?
The cold start problem in machine learning refers to the challenge of training a model when there is insufficient data or no prior knowledge about certain inputs or outputs. It arises when a system requires a certain amount of time to collect enough training data and start producing meaningful predictions.
2. What is the most reliable way to demonstrate a return on investment of a machine learning system?
Demonstrating the return on investment (ROI) of a machine learning system can be challenging, but there are several reliable approaches to consider. One way is to start with the outcome you want to achieve and measure it by collecting new data. This involves defining clear objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with your business goals.
3. What are the 4 reasons for lack of correlation between offline performance gain and business value gain? Make up a hypothetical example - name concrete offline metrics, and business metrics. 
1.Time Lag: There can be a time delay between improvements in offline performance and the realization of business value.
2.External Factors: External factors such as changes in market conditions, customer preferences, or competitive landscape can influence business value independently of offline performance.
3.Measurement Challenges: Measuring offline performance and business value accurately can be challenging.
4.Complex Causal Relationships: The relationship between offline performance and business value can be complex and influenced by multiple factors.
4. What is git? Describe the most often used git commands?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
some of the most often used Git commands:
git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
git add: Adds changes or new files to the staging area.
git commit: Records changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
git status: Shows the current status of the repository, including modified files and untracked files.
git push: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.
5. Given two vectors $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$ $\in \mathcal{R}^{d}$, describe in words and equations what their dot product means? 
The dot product of two vectors x and y in Rd is a scalar value that represents the degree of similarity or correlation between the two vectors. It is also known as the inner product or scalar product  .
6. Explain what a vector norm is?
The dot product of two vectors x and y in Rd is a scalar value that represents the degree of similarity or correlation between the two vectors. It is also known as the inner product or scalar product .
7. What role does chain rule play in automatic differentiation? Why automatic differentiation is important for modern AI
models?
Automatic differentiation is a technique used to compute the derivatives of a function specified by a computer program. It is a computational method that makes heavy use of the chain rule to compute exact numerical derivatives.
8. Write the equation for a standard linear model in vector notation?
The equation for a standard linear model in vector notation can be written as:
y=Xβ+ε
where:
y is a vector of outputs,
X is a matrix of inputs,
β is a vector of coefficients to be estimated, and
ε is a vector of error terms
9. Write a formula for the normal distribution? Give examples of what may be normally distributed data? 
The normal distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetrically shaped like a bell curve. It is characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The formula for the normal distribution is:
p(x) = e−(x − μ)2/2σ2/σ √2π.
10. Describe what a negative log likelihood is?
The negative log likelihood (NLL) is a mathematical function used in statistics and machine learning to measure the discrepancy between a probability distribution predicted by a model and the observed data. It is often used as a loss function in various optimization algorithms, such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.
11. Write down the formula for cross-entropy loss and explain how it is used?
The cross-entropy loss is a mathematical function used in machine learning to measure the discrepancy between a predicted probability distribution and the true distribution of a classification problem. It is commonly used as a loss function in tasks such as binary or multi-class classification.
Cross-entropy loss=−(ylog(p)+(1−y)log(1−p))
