1. What does cold start problem mean in Machine Learning in practice? How does it examplify in book?

The "cold start problem" happens when a model encounters new or unfamiliar data. During this situation, the model may struggle due to its lack of prior information about the new data, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions or inadequate performance.

2. What is the most reliable way to demonstrate a return on investment of a machine learning system?

The most reliable way to demonstrate the return on investment (ROI) of a machine learning system is to define clear objectives aligned with business goals, track key performance metrics, and calculate the difference in outcomes achieved with the system compared to baseline data. This involves considering both the costs of development and operation and the benefits in terms of improved efficiency, cost savings, or increased revenue. 

3. What are the 4 reasons for lack of correlation between offline performance gain and business value gain? Make up a hypothetical example - name concrete offline metrics, and business metrics. 

- Assumption of User Behavior: Occasionally, there is an inclination to assume that making a product faster or superior will automatically result in increased usage or customer engagement, which may not always hold true due to factors like user awareness or interest.
- Anticipating Outcomes: On certain occasions, alterations take time to yield noticeable outcomes. For instance, if we enhance the intelligence of a computer program, it might require a period before it begins contributing to customer retention.
- Different Goals: The absence of a consistent correlation between enhancements in internal operations and customer-oriented or business imperative objectives.
- Missing Information: Enhancing technical aspects may not necessarily translate into financial gains if other critical elements are inadequately addressed or mishandled.

Hypothetical example: A telecommunications company aims to reduce call center response times, thinking that faster service will lead to higher customer retention rates. They succeed in cutting response times significantly but are surprised when customer retention rates remain unchanged. This could be because customers value issue resolution and service quality more than the speed of response, highlighting the lack of correlation between response time and customer retention.
Offline metrics: Response time, issue resolution time
Business metrics: Customer retention rate, customer churn rate

4. What is git? Describe the most often used git commands?

It's a system, often used in software development, that keeps track of changes made to the code. This system helps manage various versions of the code and allows multiple people to work together on the same project. Some commonly used commands in this system are git branch, git push, git log, git diff, git clone, git add, git checkout, and git status.

5. Given two vectors $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$ $\in \mathcal{R}^{d}$, describe in words and equations what their dot product means?

The dot product of two vectors is a way to measure how much they are aligned in the same direction. When the result is positive, it means they are pointing in the same direction. If it's negative, they are pointing in opposite directions, and if it's zero, they are perpendicular or at right angles to each other.

$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(X_{i}\times Y_{b})$

6. Explain what a vector norm is?

A vector norm is a mathematical concept that measures the size or extent of a vector. It tells us how long or large a vector is within a particular vector space.

7. What role does chain rule play in automatic differentiation? Why automatic differentiation is important for modern AI
models?

The chain rule is a mathematical tool that assists AI systems in comprehending how altering one aspect of a mathematical formula impacts the entire equation.

Automatic differentiation accelerates and enhances the learning process of AI models. Without it, teaching AI models would be time-consuming and challenging. It aids in the creation and comprehension of new AI models, serving as a valuable tool for building and analyzing AI programs. Furthermore, it finds applications in science and engineering, particularly in solving problems related to changes and motion.

8. Write the equation for a standard linear model in vector notation?

$\begin{bmatrix}x_{1} \\x_{2} \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}b_{1} & b_{2} \\\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}y_{1}  \\y_{2} \end{bmatrix}$

9. Write a formula for the normal distribution? Give examples of what may be normally distributed data? 

Examples of data that typically follow a Gaussian distribution include the heights and weights of adults, IQ scores, blood pressure measurements, test scores, and ages within populations.

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

10. Describe what a negative log likelihood is?

Negative log likelihood (NLL) serves as a measure of how well a guess or model aligns with actual data. Minimizing the NLL is akin to bringing our guess or model in close agreement with reality, much like aiming for a high score in a game to demonstrate the accuracy of our prediction.

11. Write down the formula for cross-entropy loss and explain how it is used?

$H(y, \hat{y}) = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \cdot \log(\hat{y}_i)$

The cross-entropy loss function is like a tool we use in classification tasks to check how well a model's guesses match the real answers. It helps us teach the model, make it better, and figure out how good it is at its job.
